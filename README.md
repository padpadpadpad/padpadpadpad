I am a microbial ecologist at the University of Exeter with broad interests that span climate change, evolution, and community ecology. I have been using R for >10 years and authored and maintain the R packages **nls.multstart** and **rTPC** and specialise in the wrangling and manipulation of large datasets and statistical analyses. I am also a bioinformatician, processing and analysing everything from 16S sequencing to _de novo_ genome assembly, the latter using bash. Basically a bit of jack-of-all-trades master of none!

All of my code and data from my publications should live on GitHub, so if you have any questions about my work, please contact me.
