I am a microbial ecologist with broad interests that span climate change, evolution, and community ecology. From January 2021, I am a postdoc working with Michel Vos at the University of Exeter. I am an avid R programmer - authoring the R packages **nls.multstart** and **rTPC** - and specialise in the wrangling and manipulation of large datasets and statistical analysis. I also have experience in bioinformatics from 16S sequencing to _de novo_ genome assembly, the latter using bash scripting. If you have any questions about my code from publications or my R packages, please do contact me.
